# Zero-shot Bi-encoder 
1. Benchmarking zero-shot classification models
2. Bi-encoder for zero-shot classification, a balance between speed & accuracy.


## Obsolete: Unified-Encoder
Exploring a unified framework for potentially many NLP tasks as encoding operations



Formalize common NLP tasks beyond Information Retrieval as 1) encoding then 2) simple operation, so that intermediate results can be cached.
